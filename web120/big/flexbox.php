 <p>As a developer, CSS flexbox makes your job easier with aligning content and having more dynamic layouts. In CSS3. flexbox helps you order content even if the size of the content is unknown. There are axis are indicators on how the direction of your blocks will go. Flex-direction has four values: row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse. And these show the row that the inline direction will be. Column-reverse and main axis will run up and down in a block direction. Opposite of the row. Knowing which axis is important to aligning will help shape your page and make your job easier with the page. Flex-direction allows the container to display and row-reverse will keep the row going also. Align-items is another important property within the flexbox that will align with the cross axis. Flex-Start and Flex-end are used to make the content line up at the start and the end of the page respectively. With these properties however we have to make sure that they are going to show up smoothly on your browser.</p> 

<p2>Nowadays, browser support for flexbox is compatible and they do not need prefixes. Prefixes were used as production code and if you did not update your website it would mess up the styling of your page. Having to constantly update your website is exhausting, but today browsers do not need these prefixes so you wouldn’t have to constantly update. Even though they are all compatible, there are still issues with flexbox with changes to the specification. Especially if you are using old versions of browsers, your styling will look out of whack (highly recommended to update your browsers). Flexbugs site help you with the bugs on your browser and give you a way to work around it. Once, you get a hang of flexbox and understand the browsers that are compatible. Your page and alignment will be fluid.
