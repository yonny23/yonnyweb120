    <p>Responsive websites and mobile applications both usually share and have the same content. However, they have differences such as interface and navigations links being a couple. Responsive websites are more designed to be viewed on a desktop, whereas mobile applications are more to be seen on a mobile device. Both responsive and mobile applications both give the same information, but there are some differences and advantages with one or the other. </p>

     <p2>Responsive websites are fiscally more affordable than an mobile application and quicker to build. Usually when you want a mobile application, you’d have to hire someone that is familiar with creating mobile apps to create it for you. This would cost money for production and labor. The convenience of a responsive website to a mobile application is another plus, as you don’t have to download anything or spend space on your phone downloading content. The easiness and basicness of a website is something that is quick, familiar and to the point. 

     For some they would rather have a mobile application on their phone than going to the responsive website. For example: downloading the Facebook application on your phone is different than going to Facebook.com and using it on the computer. There is more of a next gen feel with applications that you don’t get with responsive websites. Mobile applications are more user friendly and the performance is faster and sleeker. One of the biggest advantages of applications over websites is that you may download content without internet access, unlike responsive website where you need a connection to navigate from page to page. Using a mobile application is more convenient on your smartphone especially when you need a notification, using a website you can’t get a notification when someone likes your post or when you receive a message. With application, you are paying for the conveniency while also having to maintain your application so you get the most securest and stable application that has been released.</p2>
