 <p>Welcome to the project that we call this portal website.</p>
 <p>Bare with me this is going to be an innovative page created by me. I am a student here at Seattle Central College, I previously got my Bachelors Degree from University of Washington Bothell and found a new found love for coding and web development so here I am making another go around at Seattle Central! Can't wait.</p>
